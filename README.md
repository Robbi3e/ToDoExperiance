⭐ Getting Started
Grab the ZIP file or clone it from GitHub - whatever works for you.

Once you’ve got the files, just open the folder and double-click on index.html. It’ll launch in the browser.

📁 What You’ll Find Inside
index.html: The whole app lives in this one file. It includes everything - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌐 What You Need
Any up-to-date browser will do the job - Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari, you name it.

No installs, no internet - just open and go.
